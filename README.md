## 🚀 Momentum: AI-Powered Habit & Mood Tracker
Built with 100% Vibe Coding. No stress, just momentum.

Momentum is a minimalist, daily companion designed to track your habits, log your mood, and provide personalized AI coaching to keep you moving forward.

The Twist? This entire application was built to showcase the power of Vibe Coding—using modern AI tools like Lovable and Gemini to go from "Idea" to "Shipped" in record time. It proves that software development is no longer about memorizing syntax; it's about vision and curation.

## ✨ Features
📊 Daily Logging: Track core habits (Meditation, Reading, Deep Work) and mood in seconds.

🤖 AI Vibe Coach: Integrated with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash. It doesn't just log data; it analyzes your mood + habits combo to give you a personalized motivational boost and a song recommendation.

🎨 Adaptive UI: A clean, "Apple-esque" aesthetic with a dynamic background that shifts based on the vibe.

💾 Cloud Sync: Fully persistent data powered by Supabase (PostgreSQL).

🌑 Dark/Light Mode: Because every app needs a dark mode.

## 🛠 The "Vibe Stack"
This project wasn't just written; it was prompted and refined using the latest in AI engineering:

Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

Backend & Auth: Supabase

AI Intelligence: Google Gemini API

Development Assistant: Lovable

## 🧠 What is "Vibe Coding"?
Vibe Coding is the philosophy that building software should be accessible to everyone. By leveraging AI agents, we focus on the logic and the user experience rather than getting stuck on missing semicolons.

This project is proof that if you can articulate an idea, you can build it.
